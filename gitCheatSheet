Some git commands (Ask Garrett or Brad if you're confused by the PR process)

(IntelliJ has a lot of these built into their VCS, but I'm unsure about Eclipse)
git pull
git checkout -b myBranch
git branch --set-upstream my_branch origin/my_branch
git push origin myBranch (Pushes branch to GitHub)

After your branch has been pushed to GitHub, select 'New Pull Request', request to merge your branch with master.
In your PR (Pull Request) message, tag someone else (@Brad--) so that they can review your code and merge it with master.
